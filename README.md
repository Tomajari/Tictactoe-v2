# Tictactoe-v2
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe implementation in C++. In addition to the traditional 3×3 board, you can choose any board size (3×3, 5×5, 7×7, etc.) at startup. The goal remains the same: get **N** of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.
